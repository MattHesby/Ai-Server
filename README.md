 A game created for people to learn Javascript

Live demonstration here:

The basis of the Hive is that the players program a bot to play the game for them. Your bot is a bee, there is a point system, and the objective is to get the most points. Your bot is sent all of the game data(player positions, game turn, etc) and has to return which direction to go next.
The rules are the following:
You cannot walk on a barrier.
when your bot steps on a flower it collects all of the pollen in a flower. 
Each round (every four turns), every flower’s pollen count increases by four. 
When two bees are on the same square, their pollen count evens out. 
If a bee goes onto another bee’s base, they collect pollen from the bees base at a rate of 4 pollen per round.
Additionally, if your bee is on another bee’s base, and that bee steps onto their own base when you are also on their base, you get teleported back to your base and lose all of the energy you had on your bee. 
When your bee goes to its own base, it drops off the pollen at its base. 
The bee with the most pollen at its base by the end of the game(1000 turns, 250 each) wins. 
They get all of the information of the game state and based on that, make a decision of which direction their bot should go in next. The map is randomly generated by my map generation algorithm, which ensures 100% fairness and impartiality for each player. The map is perfectly symmetrical across four quadrants and decides where the players bases are, the flowers, and barricades. The generation rules are the following:
Every single base needs to be accessible from every other base
Every single flower needs to be accessible by every base.
